# NYC Transit Overtime & Labor Cost Analysis (Power BI)

## Overview
This project analyzes overtime usage and labor costs using publicly available NYC payroll data. The goal is to understand how overtime hours and overtime spending vary across boroughs and job titles, and to measure how dependent operations are on overtime overall.

The analysis is designed to mirror the type of budget and workforce analysis performed in transit operations, such as NYCT Buses.
